# TODO

- [ ] Check if this is even viable 😭
- [ ] Figure out how to shrink a partition without deleting the whole drive.
- [ ] See if I can make a Linux kernel boot from a Windows boot entry (bcdedit magic?).
- [ ] Permission mapping: How do I make a Windows "User" own files on Linux?
- [ ] BitLocker: Find a way to detect it so I don't try to "bridge" an encrypted drive.
- [ ] Host networking: Confirm if I need that --network host logic for local transfers. (PTSD of mine from my mini homelab)
